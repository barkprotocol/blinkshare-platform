## BlinkShare Wallet

The bot includes a built-in wallet feature, providing a seamless way for users to interact with blockchain actions:

- **Wallet Creation**:  
  Use the `/blinkshare start` command to generate your personal Solana wallet.  
  After creation, users can deposit funds to manage and execute transactions directly from Discord.

- **Exporting Private Keys**:  
  The `/blinkshare export` command allows users to securely retrieve their wallet's private key.  
  - **Privacy First**: This response is visible only to the user.  
  - **Cross-Server Use**: Wallets are portable and can be used across multiple servers.

## BlinkShare Bot's Utility

The BlinkShare Bot adds tremendous value to servers by unfurling Solana action URLs. When a Blink URL is posted in a chat, the bot automatically recognizes it and responds with an embed containing actionable buttons for blockchain transactions.

**Example**:  
A user posts a custom BlinkShare link to buy SOL or $BARK tokens. The bot unfurls the link, displays the available actions, and allows users to execute the transaction with a single click.

## Solana Wallet Security

Wallet security is a top priority for BlinkShare. Here's how your wallet is protected:

1. **Private Key Encryption**:  
   - Private keys are immediately encrypted using a **Key Management Service (KMS)** with advanced algorithms.
   - The encryption key is stored in a secure digital vault, inaccessible to anyone—including the BlinkShare team.

2. **Secure Storage**:  
   - Encrypted private keys remain unreadable and unusable without KMS decryption.
   - Even in the event of unauthorized access, your private key is fully protected.

3. **Transaction Security**:  
   - When a transaction is triggered via Discord, the private key is securely decrypted by the KMS to sign the transaction.
   - Users retain full control over their wallets, ensuring seamless and secure transactions.

4. **Key Access**:  
   - Users can export their private keys anytime, but BlinkShare guarantees no one—including administrators—can access or decrypt these keys without explicit user action.

With this multi-layered security approach, BlinkShare provides both convenience and confidence in wallet management.
